# NCDS
The present world is technology driven as it is employed by almost all domains in performing their operations efficiently. In the case of police department, the need for good record-keeping and information sharing practice is very significance in modern times. Not only do good records provide crucial internal information, police now need to communicate within department or department-to-department across the country, in order to protect the citizens. The proposed system applies to all Police stations across the country and looks into the subject of Centralized Crime Records Management. It is well understood that crime prevention, detection and conviction of criminals depend on a highly responsive backbone of information management. The efficiency of the police and the effectiveness with which it tackles crime depend on what quality of information it can derive from its existing records and how fast it can have access to it. It will be implemented by digitalising the present records, which accesses information across all records in the state thus helping speedy and successful completion to cases. The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of thedatabase.

The application for the storage of the data has been planned using the constructs of SQL server and all the user interfaces have been designed using Python GUI. Queries will be used to provide data relating ciminals’ bio, crimes, and other data like case details, policemen investigating, etc. Different types of users will have different level of view and access to the database.

The project will have deep impact on the police working and aid in their investigation and record keeping.

The various Softwares used are-
1.	PyCharm 3.8- used as editor for coding in python
2.	DB Browswer- Used for viewing Database.

It is recommended to use display of size 1500x800 for optimal view.
The various APIs are as follows-
1.	tkinter module-The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.
2.	datetime module-Datetime module comes built into Python, so there is no need to install it externally. Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals. 

3.	matplotlib module-Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

4.	sqlite3 module-SQLite3 can be integrated with Python using sqlite3 module,To use sqlite3 module, you must first create a connection object that represents the database and then optionally you can create a cursor object, which will help you in executing all the SQL statements.


5.	pillow module-Python Imaging Library is a free library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

6.	os module-The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.

7.	uuid module-UUID, Universal Unique Identifier, is a python library which helps in generating random objects of 128 bits as ids.
